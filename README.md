Abstract: today, with the development of the Internet, the research on students' learning situation has changed from traditional paper-based test to online test.The construction, management and use of the network question bank are becoming more and more frequent and ubiquitous, which has become one of the indispensable and important parts of the teaching and learning process for teachers and students.In order to solve this practical problem, the team plans to adopt the processing scheme of PHP+MySQL, combined with the front-end presentation of HTML, and based on B/S architecture, develop and implement the release management and test system of network question bank.The system is divided into three modules: administrator, teacher and student. Each module has its own specific function. Through the mutual connection of the database in the background, these functions realize the function of mutual correlation and mutual influence.At the same time, the system also provides data analysis function for teachers and students, which can understand the recent situation in real time.

Introduction: with the rapid development of the Internet, more and more things can be handled more quickly on the Internet.Similarly, if students can complete homework and exercises on the Internet, they can get enough exercises more quickly, and can complete and submit them at any time according to their own needs, thus avoiding students' difficulty in obtaining exercises of corresponding subjects to practice the learning content.For teachers, correcting exercises done by students has always been a time-consuming and laborious task. However, if the exercises can be completed and submitted online, the homework can be corrected by computer, greatly reducing the burden on teachers. In addition, teachers can release exercises at any time as required.Therefore, we designed the question bank management system to make it more convenient for both students and teachers to operate.

1 subject analysis

1.1 project background

In the process of learning, students need enough questions to practice and test the knowledge they have learned. However, sometimes it is difficult for students to master which parts are the objects that need to be practiced, and when they need to practice, they do not have corresponding exercises, which is even more difficult to achieve the key exercises of specific difficulty.Correspondingly, the teacher has a sufficient understanding of the key parts of the course and a large number of exercises, but it is difficult to communicate with the students in need at any time.And students in the completion of exercises, exercises to correct and explain is also a huge amount of work.

In view of the above contradictions, we designed a question bank management system to solve them, so that students can grasp the key content of the course at any time and conduct difficulty selection of exercises done, conduct self-adaptive exercises, and timely obtain correction and explanation of exercises.At the same time, teachers can adjust the content of the question bank for students to practice at any time, and check students' practice.The realization of these functions can alleviate and even solve the contradiction mentioned above to a large extent.

1.1.1 domestic research overview

Many universities or institutions in China have designed their own question bank management system, but the system used for examination paper is more and the system used for students' practice is less.

1.1.2 overview of foreign research

Most foreign universities have perfect question bank management system.

1.2 research purpose and significance

Make the student be able to carry on practice to the exercise that oneself need at any time, facilitate a teacher to give a problem for the student, omit to correct the step of exercise.

1.3 the work done in this article

This paper is the database curriculum design report, for this group to realize the question bank management system implementation process and implementation results to explain.This system applies the relevant theories of database system to practice. The specific work we have done is as follows:

(1) in the feasibility analysis and planning stage of the system, the status quo of the question bank management system is briefly introduced, and the technical route to realize the system is also given.

(2) at the stage of requirement analysis and overall design of the system, the functional modules and basic architecture of the system are presented.

(3) in the detailed design and specific implementation stage, I completed the function module design, function design and database design of the question bank management system, and completed the realization of specific functions.
